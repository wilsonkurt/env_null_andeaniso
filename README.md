Github repository for supplemental R code for Wilson and McCool, The Environmental Null: Documenting the Changing Influence of Physical and Social Environments on Prehistoric Andean Diets

The rmarkdown file in this github repository provides the full code to rerun the analyses from the Wilson and McCool manuscript. The data needed to run this code is being published in the forthcoming manuscript Wilson et al. "Climate and Demography Differentially Constrain Dietary Variation in the Prehispanic Andes". A link to this supplemental data will be uploaded as soon as it is available.
